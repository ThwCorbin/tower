# Tower of Turtles

Play a game of Tower of Turtles! How many moves will it take you to move all of the turtles to a different tower? A tricky game based on [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi, "Wikipedia entry for Tower of Hanoi").

## Description

The player selects a turtle from the top of a stack. Then the player selects the tower base to which they want to move the turtle. Larger turtles cannot move on top of smaller turtles. Keep moving turtles until all of the turtles are restacked on a different tower base than they all started on.

This game is my fourth project for [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/ "General Assembly homepage") Software Engineering Immersive program.

## Features

I developed a bronze/silver/gold plan, which is available in the planning directory in this repo. I completed all bronze level and some silver level features. I still need to replace the colored element blocks with SVG turtles and make the game responsive on devices smaller than 768px and larger than 1200px. I designed the game based on an iPad's dimensions. I did not attempt any gold level features, and I do not plan to do so. I revised my plan on several occasions to provide a better end product for a user. I updated the planning documents as needed to aid understanding, but there are differences between these documents and the features in the current game.
